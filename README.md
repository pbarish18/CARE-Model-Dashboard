# CARE-Model-Dashboard
The Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics developed the C.A.R.E. Model Ratio to track how public Division I institutions spent shared athletics revenue (eg. conference, NCAA, and post-season football media rights) on direct athlete benefits (athletic student aid, meals, and medical expenses). This dashboard tracks that expense ratio.
